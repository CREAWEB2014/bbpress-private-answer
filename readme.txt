== Description ==

bbPress Private Answer allows you to add privacy to you forums, allowing users to mark their topics and replies as private and only site admins, moderators and topic/reply authors can view these posts.

When a topic/reply is made private, the topic/reply content, excerpt, and feed will be overwritten to the cusotm notice you chose in the General Settings section. When the topic is private, the user who does not have permission to access it, will be redirected to the home page of your site (or a custom redirect using <code>se_PrivatePost_redirect</code> filter).

In the admin, admins and moderators can edit topics/replies and toggle on/off making these posts private.

In the admin posts list, you'll get to see which are made as private.
